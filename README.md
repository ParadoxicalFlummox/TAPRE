# TAPRE: Tracking & Analytics Platform for Real Estate

## Project Tech Stack Decision and Architecture Overview

### 1. Chosen Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vue.js  
  - Open source, community-driven, approachable, and flexible.
- **Backend:** Go (Gin)  
  - Minimal, performant, and lets you build your stack your way.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
  - Robust, scalable, and ideal for structured data.

### 2. Rationale and Comparisons

#### Frontend Frameworks

| Framework | License | Led by         | Community Governance | Language      | File Type     | Learning Curve | Notable          |
|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| React     | MIT     | Meta (Facebook)| Limited             | JS/TS + JSX   | .js/.tsx      | Moderate       | Most popular     |
| Angular   | MIT     | Google         | Limited             | TypeScript    | .ts/.html     | Hard           | Enterprise       |
| **Vue.js**| MIT     | Community      | Open/Active         | JS/TS         | .vue          | Easy           | Very popular     |
| Svelte    | MIT     | Community      | Open/Active         | JS/TS         | .svelte       | Easiest        | Fast-growing     |

- All use JavaScript/TypeScript, but Vue.js stands out for openness and ease of use.
- Vue.js uses single file components (`.vue`), splitting template, logic, and style.

#### Backend in Go (Gin)

- **Gin** is lightweight, expressive, and very popular in the Go ecosystem.
- Gives you routing, middleware, and JSON handling—but you assemble your own architecture (ORM, sessions, etc.).
- Perfect for containerization (Docker/Kubernetes).

##### Gin vs. Echo

| Feature      | Gin                       | Echo                      |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| API          | Minimal, expressive       | More features out of box  |
| Performance  | Extremely fast            | Extremely fast            |
| Middleware   | Large ecosystem           | Many built-in             |
| Documentation| Clear, extensive          | Good                      |
| Community    | Very active               | Active                    |

- Gin is often chosen for its elegance and popularity; Echo for its all-in-one approach.
- Both are suitable, but Gin is recommended if you prefer its style.

### 3. Typical App Architecture

```
User (Browser/App)
   |
   v
Frontend (Vue.js)
   |
   v
REST API (Go + Gin)
   |
   v
PostgreSQL Database
```

#### Example Workflow

- **User registers:** Vue.js app sends POST to `/api/signup`, Gin handles validation and writes to PostgreSQL.
- **User logs in:** Receives a JWT for future authenticated requests.
- **CRUD actions:** Vue.js calls REST endpoints for tasks, Gin talks to PostgreSQL.

---

### 4. Summary

- **Vue.js + Gin + PostgreSQL** is a highly open, flexible, and modern stack.
- Each layer is container-friendly and widely supported.
- You have control over each part, with a welcoming learning curve and vibrant communities.

  - Highlight underperforming properties.
- **Rent Comparison:** 
  - Compare user’s rent to market averages (via integration or manual input).
  - Provide suggestions for rent optimization.
- **Advice & Insights:** 
  - Show actionable tips to improve property performance (e.g., raise rent, reduce expenses).
